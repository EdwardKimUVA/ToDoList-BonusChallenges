# ToDoList-BonusChallenges
Has a To do list program as well as a palindrome checker + array randomizer in javascript

It is necessary to have node.exe downloaded, then once the path is built (using cd to travel through the directory) the program will be run using 
node challenge1.js
The program should then run the test cases on its own for the To do list, palindrome, and array randomizer.
